# Working With Ember Data

In this section, we cover how to use TypeScript effectively with specific Ember Data APIs \(anything you'd find under the `@ember-data` package namespace\).

We do _not_ cover general usage of Ember Data; instead, we assume that as background knowledge. Please see the Ember Data [Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/models) and [API docs](https://api.emberjs.com/ember-data/release)!
