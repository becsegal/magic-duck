# Working With Ember

In this section, we cover how to use TypeScript effectively with specific Ember APIs \(anything you'd find under the `@ember` package namespace\).

We do _not_ cover general usage of Ember; instead, we assume that as background knowledge. Please see the Ember [Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/) and [API docs](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release)!
