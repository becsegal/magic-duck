# Working With Ember Classic

We emphasize the happy path of working with Ember in the [Octane Edition](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/). However, there are times you’ll need to understand these details:

1. Most existing applications make heavy use of the pre-Octane \(“legacy”\) Ember programming model, and we support that model—with caveats.
2. Several parts of Ember Octane \(specifically: routes, controllers, services, and class-based helpers\) continue to use these concepts under the hood, and our types support that—so understanding them may be important at times.

The rest of this guide is dedicated to helping you understand how `ember-cli-typescript` and the classic Ember system interact.
